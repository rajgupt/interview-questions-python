Given an array A of size N. The elements of the array consists of positive integers. You have to find the largest element with minimum frequency.

Input Format: First line of input contains number of testcases T. For each testcase there will be two lines. First line contains N, next line contains N elements separated by spaces.

Output Format: For each testcase, print the largest element with minimum frequency.

User Task:
Your task is to complete the provided function LargButMinFreq(A, n) which accepts array A and n. Hence you have to return the largest element with minimum frequency.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 106

Example:
Input:
1
5
2 2 5 50 1

Output:
50

Explanation :
Testcase 1: All elements are having frequency 1 except 2. 50 is the maximum element with minimum frequency.
